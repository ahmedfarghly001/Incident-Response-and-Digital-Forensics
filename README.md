# Incident-Response-and-Digital-Forensics
Objective: Simulate a cybersecurity incident, respond to it, and conduct a digital
forensic investigation to identify the root cause.
Week 1: Incident Detection and Containment
 Task: Set up a simulated environment and trigger a security incident (e.g.,
malware infection).
 Deliverables: Incident detection logs, containment strategy documentation.
Week 2: Digital Forensics Investigation
 Task: Perform a forensic investigation to gather evidence (memory analysis,
disk forensics) and determine the attack vector.
 Deliverables: Forensic analysis report, timeline of the attack, and chain of
custody documentation.
Week 3: Incident Eradication and Recovery
 Task: Remove malware, eradicate the threat, and restore affected systems to
normal operation.
 Deliverables: Incident eradication plan, recovery steps, post-incident security
measures.
Week 4: Post-Incident Reporting, Improvement, and Presentation
 Task: Write a comprehensive incident response report, provide
recommendations to prevent future incidents, and prepare a presentation.
 Deliverables: Incident response report, recommendations for enhancing
security controls and awareness. Final presentation summarizing the incident
response process and findings.
